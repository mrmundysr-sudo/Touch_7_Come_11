// Match play: a race to 7 or 11 points across several games. Pure data, no DOM.
//
// Points per game:
//   - winning by sealing both targets:                      2
//   - winning when the deck runs dry:                       1
//   - losing a seal-out game while still holding one seal:  1 (a consolation point)
//   - a drawn game, or a deck-out loss:                     0
// A player who ends their own turn with both targets sealed wins on the spot, so the loser of a seal-out game
// holds at most one seal.
//
// The match ends when someone has reached the target and leads. If both reach it in the same game, the higher total
// wins; if they are level, play goes on (sudden death) until one player is ahead. The player who opens the first
// game is chosen by the caller; after that the opening seat alternates every game.
